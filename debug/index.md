# Debugging WordPress

Debugging means identifying and eliminating errors or problems in your code. The last step in debugging is to test the correctness of the code and make sure that the problem doesn't happen again.

This is mostly done by developers using debugging tools and is routine in the software development stage. The debugging process can be done using strategies like unit tests, code review, and pair programming.

Before the code or software is released to users, developers will try to find any problems, then isolate, and fix them.

Sometimes fixing the code can be a real hassle, as it can take longer than writing the code itself.

## Debugging types {#debuggin-types}

You can debug PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, on a single or Multisite and Network, etc.

### Debug WordPress

WordPress comes with [specific debug systems](https://github.com/WordPress/Advanced-administration-handbook/blob/main/debug/debug-wordpress.md) designed to simplify the process as well as standardize code across the core, plugins, and themes.

### Debug JavaScript

If you're having trouble with its interactive functionality, it may be due to JavaScript errors or conflicts. The [Debug JavaScript](https://github.com/WordPress/Advanced-administration-handbook/blob/main/debug/debug-javascript.md) will help you.

### Debug WordPress Multisite / Network

If you have multiple installations, [Debug network](https://github.com/WordPress/Advanced-administration-handbook/blob/main/debug/debug-network.md) will help you if you need to debug it.

### Test Driving WordPress

There are times when you need to test changes to your WordPress-powered site out of the public eye. Introducing changes to a live site could adversely affect your readers. You have several choices in [Test Driving WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/Advanced-administration-handbook/blob/main/debug/test-driving.md).
